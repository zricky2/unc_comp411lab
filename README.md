# unccomp411lab
Labs for Comp 411 at UNC

These labs were assigned for Comp 411 (Computer Organization) at UNC during fall of 2019.

You will be programming in C and in assembly (MIPS).

Good luck with the course. It is a tough one.

If you are taking the course, do not copy the code. Use it as reference.

If you are not taking the course and just want to learn make sure you are familiar with C programming and MIPS assembly.
